Courses completed, with coded examples.

Note:  Created Youtube video displaying SnapML Librarys its use and its effectiveness in modeling build/execution times.
Purposefully left out datasets, as they can be downloaded.  No need to create another repository as they are stored on a number of hosted sites.

Left out "Honors LAB" as part of the course, as this was optional... some labs included are optional work
Left out AI capstone as the work and concepts learned will do no good to anyone not willng to put in the effort.
 --- with that said:  Ill eventually publish them, just not now.
