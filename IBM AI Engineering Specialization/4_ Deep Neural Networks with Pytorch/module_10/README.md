These notebooks are for archival purposes, learning references... and as such the CAPSTONE work is not included.
Should you feel the need to master these skills, you are best off learning and mastering the concepts of the content of the course.

Copy and pasting is nice to do, but learning the concepts, and deriving solutions on your own -> gives more value to you and your work, as well future works.

Good luck on your ML adventure.
