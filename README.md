These are some courses Ive finished while on my ML /AI Journey.  For the most part, its contains labs, and many fill in the code (solutions).

THe RED TEAMING LLM --- purposely left blank... its just too easy to fool LLM  no need to provide instructions.

North Carolina State University AI COHORT was fun.  Unpaid intership, learned alot, shared alot of great code with all my colleages while creating many projects.

DEEPLEARNING.AI course to be published soon

... there are other projects , personal and course material that will soon be published, as soon as I organize NAS files.
